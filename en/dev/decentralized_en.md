# Decentralization

### What is Decentralization?
  - Decentralization is the opposite of centralization. Definition of Decentralization need to be developed; Definition of Decentralization can be defined through the inductive method with definition of its opposite term.
  - Centralization
    1. Generation of information and its delivery have a dominant party, all ecosystem participants are controlled by the dominant party.
    2. In the centralized ecosystem, participants do not have any authority in control of the ecosystem, but only dominant party has all authorities on the control of the ecosystem.
  - Decentralization
    1. Creation of information and its delivery can be processed by ecosystem participants and the whole process is opened transparently to the public.
    2. Participants can join and exit the ecosystem without any constraints.
    3. All participants can be the dominance in the ecosystem; and they works with self-interest as their motivation.

### Why Decentralization?
  - In the centralized ecosystem, asymmetry of the information is inevitable due to the  monopolizing information of the dominant party. In accordance with above activity, social benefit is being generated, but the dominant party takes this social benefit. Guarantee on the dominance of a certain information is moralistically determined. The cost of governance to verify it constitutes most of the value produced by the production and distribution of information
  - Though the decentralization, distribution loss and social cost to monitor the dominant partyâ€™s monopolization of information and resource can be distributed to ecosystem participants. Also, individuals can select the ecosystem suits to themselves; it may solve the freerider problems in the centralized ecosystem

#### Decentralization reduces the social cost as a whole by fragmenting the ecosystem more efficiently into smaller units rather than the concept of eliminating centralized middle-man of the existing ecosystem and by maximizing the benefit and interests of participants.
