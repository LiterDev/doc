# Blockchain Layer
This is the core layer of LITER blockchain. This layer will record all LITER PATRON’s activities including responses, and manage everything related to LITER CUBE and LITER COIN or any other crypto currency that may be involved on the LITER ecosystem in the future. This layer will be constructed to match LITER ecosystem’s characteristics by comparing and analyzing concepts and hypotheses of smart contract based blockchains such as Ethereum or EOS.

## Why EOS?
LITER will develop and operate blockchain nodes based on EOS after evaluation of suitability of LITER platform to EOS.

### Blockchain that suits LITER platform requires:
1.	Fast transaction and confirm speed since LITER is user-driven service platform.
2.	Able to transfer policies and rights to users after centralized governance ends, which LITER plans to do at the beginning of the service launch in order to stabilize the service.
3.	Reward policies can be changeable. As LITER is incentivized platform, reward policy may be updated due to changes of economic and systemic circumstances.
4.	Separation between core contract and application contract.

Considering above requirements, it is concluded that DPOS algorithm suits LITER and planned to develop [graphene](https://objectcomputing.com/resources/publications/sett/march-2017-graphene-an-open-source-blockchain) based blockchain that was also used in bitshare and steemit while researching other capable blockchains.

### Introduction of EOS DAWN 3.0
1. Separation between block generation and block operation policies through bio contract enables policy updates or modifications without hard fork, which is very similar to what LITER blockchain required, the separation between core contract and application contract.
2. 0.5 sec per block generation enables actual user responses to be stored on chain without failover, and it is fast enough to be comparable to centralized service operation.

#### From the evaluation results, EOS with DPOS algorithm, fast transaction speed, and easy operation of own nodes is the optimized blockchain for LITER at the beginning of its service. 

## Irreversible Data
Data that cannot be changed and is to be stored on blockchain 

  - LITER defines Irreversible Data satisfying following conditions:
    * Does data require trust?
    * Should be disclosed for transparency
    * Does it contain value to be passed down through generations?

   
  - Irreversible Data in LITER
    * Liter Cube transaction
    * Liter Coin transaction
    * Reivew Generation Information
    * User response transaction
    * Reward transaction
